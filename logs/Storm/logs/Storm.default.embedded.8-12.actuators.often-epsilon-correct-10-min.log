 WARN (GeneralSettings.cpp:110): Setting the precision option with module prefix does not effect all solvers. Consider setting --precision instead of --general:precision.
 WARN (Program.cpp:178): The input model is a CTMC, but uses probabilistic commands like they are used in PRISM. Consider rewriting the commands to use Markovian commands instead.

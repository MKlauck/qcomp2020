 WARN (GeneralSettings.cpp:110): Setting the precision option with module prefix does not effect all solvers. Consider setting --precision instead of --general:precision.
 WARN (Program.cpp:178): The input model is a CTMC, but uses probabilistic commands like they are used in PRISM. Consider rewriting the commands to use Markovian commands instead.
 WARN (Program.cpp:1264): The model uses synchronizing Markovian commands. This may lead to unexpected verification results, because of unclear semantics.

############################## Notes ##############################
The tool result '153562481458987598603727/500000000000000000000000' is tagged as incorrect. The reference result is 'OrderedDict([('lower', 0.3071247592692875), ('upper', 0.3071247593307125)])' (approx. OrderedDict([('lower', 0.3071247592692875), ('upper', 0.3071247593307125)])) which means a relative error of '6.628813097273992e-07' which is larger than the goal precision '1e-14'.

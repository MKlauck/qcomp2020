 WARN (Program.cpp:178): The input model is a CTMC, but uses probabilistic commands like they are used in PRISM. Consider rewriting the commands to use Markovian commands instead.
 WARN (Program.cpp:1264): The model uses synchronizing Markovian commands. This may lead to unexpected verification results, because of unclear semantics.

############################## Notes ##############################
The tool result '10565798479400001/100000000000000000' is tagged as incorrect. The reference result is 'OrderedDict([('lower', 0.001072402434), ('upper', 0.001072402634)])' (approx. OrderedDict([('lower', 0.001072402434), ('upper', 0.001072402634)])) which means a relative error of '97.52454800479352' which is larger than the goal precision '0.001'.
